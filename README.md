## Context:
[//]: <>

This project was assigned as the final solo project at Turing, with a limited deadline to simulate take-home challenge timeframes that will occur during the upcoming job search for students. 

## Technologies
- Svelte
- Svelte - Routing
- Cypress
  

## Learning Goals:
- Meet short deadline to replicate take-home challenge workflow
- Present final result and discuss successful and unsuccessful design choices with peers
- Challenge myself to use a new JS framework (Svelte) to recreate the majority of concepts that I have applied with React

## Challenges & Wins:
- Successfully implemented Svelte to render a multi page (routed) application
- Followed Turing style guidelines with new language, demanding 'developer empathy' of myself

## Future Feature Ideas:
[//]: <>
- Fix rendering for single page view
- Complete styling for presentation quality, rather than basic functionality and proof of concept
- Finish testing suite to ensure standards have been followed for E2E concerns


## Testing Instructions:
[//]: <>

To run the test suite associated with the classes behind the scenes and how they interact: 
Run 'npm run cypress' from the terminal while within the main directory of the application and select E2E Testing, and your chosen browser in the following window.
